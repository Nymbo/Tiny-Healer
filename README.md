# Tiny-Healer

## TL;DR
Tiny Healer is made with the gameplay loop of a healer in World of Warcraft in mind. Healing in a dungeon minus the game.

## Rules
You are a healer, you cannot die yourself.
Target your allies and cast spells to heal them (keybinds are 1-5).
Allies automatically attack the boss.
Game Over when all allies are dead.
Victory when the boss is dead.

## Mechanics
The boss deals damage to a random ally every second.
The boss periodically applies a Bleed to a random ally.
You regenerate Mana passively.
The Global Cooldown is 1.5 sec.

## Usage
It's only a few hundred lines of Pygame! The idea is to have a structure to tweak/tune mechanics and create your own boss encounters.
